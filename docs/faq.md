## FAQ

__Which problem does this plugin solve?__

When you need to introduce the concept of the Matomo HTTP Tracking API, you need to find your Matomo endpoint (the url of your tracker). There are several ways to do so, but I found them too long (copying/pasting the image tracking code and then stripping out unecessary caracters), so that's why I created this plugin.

__Are there any evolutions planned?__

The general idea is to make the concept of the Matomo HTTP Tracking API easier to understand, so I will probably add some data collection method in order for users to easily identify how to push data to Matomo and see how the data looks like within the Matomo UI.

__How is the plugin maintained?__

As I am living my profesionnal career thanks to the Matomo software, I am maintaining this plugin all the time, though as I don't have a developer background I am not 100% sure I can fix bugs very fast.
